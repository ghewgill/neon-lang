--! Missing closing comment '*/'

/* This test is specifically designed to BEGIN the Block-Comment ending token,
   but leaving off the last part of it, as well as ANY other data in the file.
   This will test the lexers ability to handle a case where it THINKS the
   token is ABOUT to end, but it does not, which is why there is NO LF at the
   end of this file, and why the test result appears at the top. */

/* Block Comment, without proper ending comment token.*
