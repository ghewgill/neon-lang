Manifesto
=========

Programming languages today are full of features, and there is a trend toward brevity.
Brevity is highly expressive, for an expert who understands the notation.
However, for a new learner or a casual user, brevity promotes unreadable code.

Principles of Design
--------------------

* Prefer keywords over punctuation
* Good error messages
* Avoid implicit behaviour
* Explicit declarations
* Single meaning per keyword/operator
* Principle of least surprise
* Easy lookup

Prefer keywords over punctuation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Punctuation is important, but it should be used sparingly.

Good error messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Error messages should explain what is wrong, with suggestions of ways to correct the problem.

Avoid implicit behaviour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There will be no hidden, implicit, or automatic calls made to code that is not expressly visible in the source.

Explicit declarations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Everything is declared, and identifiers from modules are always qualified.

Single meaning per keyword/operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To the greatest reasonable extent, keywords and operators only have one meaning.

Principle of least surprise
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This one is hard to quantify, but it's good.

Easy lookup
^^^^^^^^^^^

By using keywords instead of punctuation, and by using explicit declarations, it is easy to look up unknown things in the documentation.
