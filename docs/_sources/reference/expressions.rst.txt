Expressions
===========

Expressions are combinations of operands and operators.
Operands are values in themselves, which may be expressions surrounded by ``( )``.
Operators are logical, arithmetic, or string and the valid operators depend on the types of the operands.

Literal Values
--------------

Literal values can be individual lexical elements such as identifiers_, numbers_, and strings_.

Literal arrays are sequences of comma-separated values surrounded by brackets ``[ ]``.

Example::

    LET a: Array<Number> := [1, 2, 3]

Literal dictionaries are sequences of comma-separated name/value pairs surrounded by braces ``{ }``.

Example::

    LET d: Dictionary<Number> := {
        "one": 1,
        "two": 2,
        "three": 3
    }

For convenience, both literal arrays and dictionaries accept a trailing comma after the final element.

Boolean Operators
-----------------

The following operators take two boolean values.

======== ============
Operator Description
======== ============
``=``    equality
``<>``   inequality
``AND``  logical conjunction
``OR``   logical disjunction
======== ============

Numeric Operators
-----------------

The following operators take two number values.

======== ===========
Operator Description
======== ===========
``+``    addition
``-``    subtraction
``*``    multiplication
``/``    division
``MOD``  modulo (remainder)
``^``    exponentiation
``=``    equality
``<>``   inequality
``<``    less than
``>``    greater than
``<=``   less than or equal
``>=``   greater than or equal
======== ===========

String Operators
----------------

The following operators take two string values.

======== ===========
Operator Description
======== ===========
``&``    concatenation
``=``    equality
``<>``   inequality
``<``    lexicographical less than
``>``    lexicographical greater than
``<=``   lexicographical less than or equal
``>=``   lexicographical greater than or equal
======== ===========

Array Operators

Operator Description
======== ===========
``IN``   membership test (*O(n)* complexity)
======== ===========

Dictionary Operators
--------------------

======== ===========
Operator Description
======== ===========
``IN``   membership test (*O(log n)* complexity)
======== ===========

Pointer Operator
----------------

Operator Description
======== ===========
``->``   pointer dereference
======== ===========

Operator Precedence
-------------------

The operator precedence is as follows, highest to lowest:

=================== ===========
Operator            Description
=================== ===========
``(`` ``)``         subexpression
``^``               exponentiation
``*`` ``/`` ``MOD`` multiplication, division, modulo
``+`` ``-`` ``&``   addition, subtraction, concatenation
``<`` ``=`` ``>``   comparison
``IN``              membership
``AND``             conjunction
``OR``              disjunction
``IF``              conditional
=================== ===========

Array Subscripts
----------------

Array subscripts are normally integers greater than or equal to zero::

    LET a: Array<String> := ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    print(a[0])
    print(a[2])

Two special values may be used, ``FIRST`` and ``LAST``::

    LET a: Array<String> := ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    print(a[FIRST])
    print(a[LAST])

``FIRST`` always means the same as `0` and is provided for completeness.
``LAST`` refers to the index of the last element of the array.

Array slices are also possible using the ``TO`` keyword.
Both indexes are inclusive::

    LET a: Array<String> := ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    LET b: Array<String> := a[0 TO 1]
    LET c: Array<String> := a[LAST-1 TO LAST]

In the above example, ``b`` contains ``["foo", "bar"]`` and ``c`` contains ``["bar", "baz"]``.

Expression Substitution
-----------------------

Literal strings may contain embedded expressions surrounded by the special escape ``\( )``.
These expressions are evaluated at run time.
The type of the embedded expression must have a ``.toString()`` method which will be called automatically to convert the result to a string.

Example::

    LET a: Array<String> := ["one", "two", "three"]
    FOR i := 0 TO 2 DO
        print("i is \(i) and the array element is \(a[i])")
    END FOR
