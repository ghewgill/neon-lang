Modules
=======

Neon code can be divided into modules, which are separate source files.
A module named ``example`` would be found in a file called ``example.neon``.

Module source code must *export* identifiers before they can be used outside the module file.
This is done with the ``EXPORT`` declaration::

    EXPORT hello

    FUNCTION hello()
        print("Hello world")
    END FUNCTION

In order to use an identifier exported by another module, the ``IMPORT`` declaration must be used.

Example::

    IMPORT os

    print(os.getenv("PATH"))

Individual identifiers may also be imported::

    IMPORT os.getenv

    print(getenv("PATH"))

Module Path
-----------

When a module is imported, the compiler must be able to locate the code for the imported module.
The followed directories are searched in order:

1. Same directory as the importing source file
2. The current directory
3. The directories in the environment variable ``NEONPATH``
4. The directories listed in the ``.neonpath`` file in the current directory
