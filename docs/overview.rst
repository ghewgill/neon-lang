Neon Overview
=============

The following is a brief description of Neon for experienced programmers.
There are plenty of examples, because experienced programmers know how to read code, and can pick up concepts more quickly by reading code than by reading a description of code.

Neon is a statically typed imperative language, with roots in Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, and `others </motivation.html>`_.
Program structure and modules are influenced by Python.

::

    -- This sample program greets the user
    -- until an empty line is entered.

    IMPORT console

    LOOP
        LET name: String := console.input("What is your name? ")
        IF name = "" THEN
            EXIT LOOP
        END IF
        print("Hello, \(name).")
    END LOOP

General
-------

All identifiers are case sensitive.
Language defined keywords are all upper case.
Semicolons are not used.
Identifier scope is defined by program block structure.
Assignments have value semantics (deep copy).
Forward declarations are not required.
All variables must be explicitly initialised before use.

Types
-----

The scalar types are:

- ``Boolean`` (``TRUE`` or ``FALSE``)
- ``Number`` (decimal floating point)
- ``String`` (Unicode text)
- ``Bytes`` (arbitrary blocks of bytes)
- enumerations (named values)

Aggregate types are:

- ``RECORD`` (named fields)
- ``CLASS`` (dynamically allocated objects)
- ``Array`` (arbitrary size vector)
- ``Dictionary`` (map indexed by a ``String`` key)

There is a dynamic ``Object`` type which can hold values of any of the concrete types.

::

    VAR x: Object
    x := 5
    print(str(x))
    x := "hello"
    print(x)

Dynamic heap allocation is supported by a ``POINTER`` type.

::

    TYPE Colour IS ENUM
        red
        green
        blue
    END ENUM

    TYPE Person IS RECORD
        name: String
        eyes: Colour
    END RECORD

    TYPE Node IS CLASS
        value: String
        next: POINTER TO Node
    END CLASS

    LET b: Boolean := TRUE
    LET n: Number := 123.456
    LET s: String := "Hello world"
    LET y: Bytes := HEXBYTES "00 01 02 03"
    LET e: Colour := Colour.green
    LET r: Person := Person(name WITH "Alice", eyes WITH Colour.green)
    LET a: Array<String> := ["fork", "knife", "spoon"]
    LET d: Dictionary<Number> := {"fork": 5, "knife": 6, "spoon": 1}
    LET p: POINTER TO Node := NEW Node(value WITH "green")

Expressions
-----------

There is a rich expression syntax including arithmetic, array slicing, conditionals, and string interpolation.

::

    LET x: Number := 5
    LET y: Number := (6 + x) / 2
    ASSERT y = 5.5

    LET a: Array<String> := ["fork", "knife", "spoon"]
    ASSERT a[1 TO LAST] = ["knife", "spoon"]

    LET r: String := (IF y < 5 THEN "small" ELSE "big")
    ASSERT r = "big"

    LET t: String := "y is a \(r) value"
    ASSERT t = "y is a big value"

Statements
----------

There are two variable declarations: ``LET`` (read-only value), and ``VAR`` (modifiable value).

::

    LET a: Number := 5

    VAR b: Number
    b := a
    b := 6

    print("\(a), \(b)")

There are two conditional blocks: ``CASE`` (multiple branches), and ``IF`` (single test).

::

    FOR a := 0 TO 9 DO
        VAR s: String
        CASE a
            WHEN < 2 DO
                s := "less than two"
            WHEN 2 DO
                s := "two"
            WHEN 3 TO 5 DO
                s := "three to five"
            WHEN 7, 9 DO
                s := "seven or nine"
            WHEN OTHERS DO
                s := "something else"
        END CASE
        print("\(a) is \(s)")
    END FOR

    IMPORT random
    IF random.uint32() < 10 THEN
        print("small")
    END IF

There are four kinds of loops: ``FOR`` (bounded iteration), ``LOOP`` (infinite loop), ``REPEAT`` (bottom-tested condition), and ``WHILE`` (top-tested condition).
The ``EXIT`` and ``NEXT`` statements branch out of the loop or to the next iteration, respectively.

::

    FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO
        print("\(i)")
    END FOR

    VAR a: Number := 1
    LOOP
        print("\(a)")
        IF a = 10 THEN
            EXIT LOOP
        END IF
        INC a
    END LOOP

    a := 1
    REPEAT
        print("\(a)")
        INC a
    UNTIL a = 10

    a := 1
    WHILE a <= 10 DO
        print("\(a)")
        INC a
    END WHILE

The exception handling statements are ``TRY`` (introduces a new handling scope), and ``RAISE`` to raise an exception.

::

    EXCEPTION PrinterOutOfPaperException

    FUNCTION printFile(name: String)
        -- Save the trees, don't print anything.
        RAISE PrinterOutOfPaperException
    END FUNCTION

    TRY
        printFile("hello.txt")
    TRAP PrinterOutOfPaperException DO
        print("Sorry, out of paper.")
    END TRY

The ``ASSERT`` statement is used to check program invariants.
Execution stops with a diagnostic dump if the condition is not satisfied.

::

    FUNCTION setRatio(percent: Number)
        ASSERT 0 <= percent <= 100
        -- ... use percent value
    END FUNCTION

Functions
---------

Functions may or may not return a value.
If a function returns a value, then the return value cannot be silently ignored by the caller.
Function parameters can be ``IN`` (default), ``OUT`` (passed back to caller), or ``INOUT`` (references caller value).

::

    IMPORT string

    FUNCTION func(name: String, OUT result: String, INOUT count: Number)
        result := string.upper(name)
        INC count
    END FUNCTION

    VAR uname: String
    VAR n: Number := 0

    -- The parameter mode (if not IN) must be explicitly indicated
    -- on the function call.
    func("charlie", OUT uname, INOUT n)

    -- The caller may choose to pass parameters in a different
    -- order using the WITH keyword.
    func("charlie", INOUT count WITH n, OUT result WITH uname)

    ASSERT uname = "CHARLIE"
    ASSERT n = 2

Methods
-------

Records and classes may have methods attached to them, to be called with the usual method syntax.

::

    TYPE Rectangle IS RECORD
        width: Number
        height: Number
    END RECORD

    FUNCTION Rectangle.area(self: Rectangle): Number
        RETURN self.width * self.height
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION Rectangle.expand(INOUT self: Rectangle, edge: Number)
        self.width := self.width + 2 * edge
        self.height := self.height + 2 * edge
    END FUNCTION

    LET r: Rectangle := Rectangle(width WITH 4, height WITH 5)
    ASSERT r.area() = 20
    r.expand(1)
    ASSERT r.area() = 42

Pointers
--------

Pointers can only point to classes.
Pointers are declared with ``POINTER TO`` and allocated with ``NEW``.

::

    TYPE Person IS CLASS
        name: String
        age: Number
    END CLASS

    LET p: POINTER TO Person := NEW Person
    p->name := "Alice"
    p->age := 23

Pointers must be checked for validity (non-NIL) before they can be used using the ``IF VALID`` block.

::

    TYPE Person IS CLASS
        name: String
        age: Number
    END CLASS

    FUNCTION incrementAge(p: POINTER TO Person)
        IF VALID p THEN
            INC p->age
        END IF
    END FUNCTION
