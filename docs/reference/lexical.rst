Lexical Structure
=================

Neon source code is encoded in UTF-8.
All keywords and identifiers are case sensitive.

Comments
--------

The comment lead-in character sequence is ``--``.
A single line comment is a ``--`` followed by arbitrary text to the end of the line.
A block comment is introduced with ``/*`` and ends with ``*/``.
Block comments may span multiple lines.
Block comments may not nest.

Example::

    -- The following line prints some text.
    print("Hello, World.")
    
    /* This comment spans multiple
       lines of text until the comment
       closing characters. */

Keywords
--------

All words that consist of only uppercase letters are reserved for keywords.

.. _identifiers:

Identifiers
-----------

An identifier is a letter followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscore.
Identifiers which consist of all uppercase letters are reserved for keywords_.

.. _numbers:

Numbers
-------

Literal numbers are in base 10 by default.

Numbers may be specified in a variety of bases (these support integers only):

* Binary preceded by ``0b``
* Octal preceded by ``0o``
* Hexadecimal preceded by ``0x``

For base 10 numbers, they may contain a fractional portion following a decimal point ``.``.
Additionally, they may have an exponent following ``e`` or ``E``.

.. _strings:

Strings
-------

Strings are sequences of Unicode characters surrounded by double quotes.
The only special character within a string is the backslash, used for character escapes.
The allowed character escapes are:

============== ============= ===========
Escape         Replacement   Description
============== ============= ===========
``\"``         "             double quote
``\\``         \\            backslash
``\b``         chr(8)        backspace
``\f``         chr(11)       form feed
``\n``         chr(10)       newline
``\r``         chr(13)       carriage return
``\t``         chr(9)        tab
``\uXXXX``     chr(XXXX)     Unicode character XXXX (where XXXX is a 4-digit hex number)
``\UXXXXXXXX`` chr(XXXXXXXX) Unicode character XXXXXXXX (where XXXXXXXX is a 8-digit hex number)
``\u{NAME}``   character     Unicode character named NAME from the `Unicode standard <https://unicode.org/versions/latest/>`_
``\()``        expression    see `expression substitution`_
============== ============= ===========

Example::

    VAR s: String

    s := "Hello, World"

Literal strings may need to contain backslashes (such as when used for regular expressions).
Instead of using normal double-quoted strings, there are two varieties of "raw strings".
The first can contain any character except ``"``::

    CONSTANT s: String := @"This string contains backslash (\) characters"

The second type of string uses arbitrary delimiters so that any literal string can be included in source.
The simplest form is::

    CONSTANT s: String := @@"This string contains backslashes (\) and "quotes"."@@

If there is a need to include the sequence ``"@@`` within the string, an arbitrary identifier may appear between the ``@`` at the start and end of the stiring.
For example::

    CONSTANT s: String := @raw@"A raw string example is @@"like this"@@."@raw@
