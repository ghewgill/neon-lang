 |  Function: copy
 |
 |  Copies a file to a new destination.  If the destination file already exists, a FileExistsException
 |  is raised, and the file is not copied.
 |
 |  Exceptions:
 |      - <FileExistsException> - If the file provided by the destination parameter already exists.
 |
 |  See Also:
 |      <copyOverwriteIfExists>
 |      <exists>
 |      <delete>
 |
 |  Example:
 |      > TRY
 |      >     file.copy("LICENSE.txt", "tmp/Copy_of_LICENSE.txt")
 |      > EXCEPTION file.FileExistsException DO
 |      >     print("File copy failed.  Destination file already exists.")
