      <p>Neon is a high-level, statically typed, imperative programming language intended for teaching and learning the craft of programming.
Its design borrows features from many <a href="motivation.html">popular languages</a>, yet carefully avoids <a href="common-errors.html">common errors</a> encountered by beginning programmers.</p>

<p>Neon is not hip (you probably won’t like it).
It is imperative and not functional; it is statically and not dynamically typed; it is verbose and not terse; it is single-threaded and not multiprocessing; it is not compiled to native code.
You will not find monads, templates, virtual functions, currying, lambdas, immutability, type inference, or probably even your favourite language feature.</p>

<p>Neon does, however, have features that can make learning programming fun.
Neon has <a href="html/index.html">standard libraries</a> for graphics, sound, text mode interfaces (curses), networking, and more.
The graphics and sound libraries recall the early days of the Apple ][ and Commodore 64.
The curses interface provides interactive text mode capability.
The ability to link to external libraries and to call external functions opens up a wide variety of possibilities.</p>

<p>There are a variety of <a href="samples/index.html">samples</a> which demonstrate the capabilities of Neon.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-neon-look-like">What does Neon look like?</h2>

<p>Neon programs start executing at the first statement in the source file.
For example, a program can be as short as this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>print("Hello, World.")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Another well-known example is the classic “FizzBuzz” program:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>% For each integer from 1 to 100, print "Fizz" if the number
% is divisible by 3, or "Buzz" if the number is divisible
% by 5, or "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both.
% Otherwise, print the number itself.

FOR i := 1 TO 100 DO
    IF i MOD 15 = 0 THEN
        print("FizzBuzz")
    ELSIF i MOD 3 = 0 THEN
        print("Fizz")
    ELSIF i MOD 5 = 0 THEN
        print("Buzz")
    ELSE
        print("\(i)")
    END IF
END FOR
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Neon syntax is not sensitive to whitespace, and does not have statement separators.
Neon source code is case sensitive, but there are no requirements on the case of user-defined identifiers.</p>
